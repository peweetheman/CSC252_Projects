This is the binary bomb project that belongs to pphill10@u.rochester.edu (Patrick Phillips). The goal was to "diffuse the binary bomb" by working through the assembly code and figuring out the correct binary string that will prevent the call to "explode" the bomb. "Diffusing the bomb" in practice involved stepping through the assembly code with the GNU debugger to understand the program and discover the seed string that would prevent the call to an explode() method.
