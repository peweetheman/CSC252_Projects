I worked through the projects of Bryant and O'Hallarons textbook <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X">Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective.</a>  

The projects included (1) recreating a dynamic memory allocator for C (implementing algorithms for malloc() and free()), (2) creating a simple Unix shell, (3) using spatial and temporal cache locality to optimize code, (4) understanding and implementing buffer overflow attacks, and (5) stepping through and debugging assembly code.
